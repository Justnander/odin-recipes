    <p> These chicken kabobs are marinated in a 4-ingredient sweet and savory honey-soy mixture that doubles as a basting sauce as the kabobs and veggies cook on the grill, adding delicious flavor to every bite of juicy chicken. </p>


    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <h3>Marinade</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> ⅓ cup honey </li>
        <li> ⅓ cup soy sauce </li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

       <li> 5 small onions, cut into 2-inch pieces</li> 
       <li>2 medium red bell peppers, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
       <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
       <li> 12 bamboo skewers, or as needed, soaked in water for 30 minutes</li>
    </ul>

        <li>To make the marinade: Whisk honey, soy sauce, oil, and black pepper together in a large glass bowl.</li>

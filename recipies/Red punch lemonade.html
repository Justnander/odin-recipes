      <p>In Texas, Big Red is a bottled soft drink also called “red soda water.” This red cream soda is often served at Juneteenth celebrations. This punch recipe is easy to make and offers a new, puckering and pleasing twist to the traditional red soda water that has been made in Texas since 1937. </p>

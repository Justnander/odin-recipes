    <h2> Ingredients </h2> 
    <ul>
    <li> 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
    <li> ⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder </li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon baking powder </li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li>
    <li> ½ cup butter, softened </li>
    <li> ¾ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li> ¼ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>  1 large egg </li>
    <li> 1 ½ tablespoons milk </li>
    <li> 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract </li>
    <li>  2 tablespoons red food coloring or to taste </li>
    <li> 1 cup dark chocolate chips, or as needed </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather all Ingredients</li>
        <li> Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. </li>
        <li>  Beat butter with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 2 minutes; beat in brown sugar and white sugar until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat egg, milk, and vanilla extract into butter mixture; beat in food coloring until uniformly colored.</li>
        <li> Stir flour mixture into butter mixture gradually with electric mixer on low speed until combined; stir in 1 cup chocolate chips. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; place in the refrigerator for 1 hour or up to overnight. </li>
        <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll dough into 2-inch balls; place on prepared baking sheets and flatten slightly.</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle cookies with a few additional chocolate chips; allow to cool completely.</li>
        <li> Place 1 scoop of ice cream on the bottom side of half of the cookies; top with remaining cookies, bottom side down. Press gently to spread ice cream to edges. Wrap each sandwich in plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.</li>
